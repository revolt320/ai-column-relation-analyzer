# AI-Powered Column Relationship Analysis

- This application allows users to upload a dataset(csv) and select any two columns for analysis.
- An AI model runs in the background to evaluate the semantic relationship between the selected columns.

- For each row in the dataset, the app:

- Determines whether the two column values are semantically related (Yes / No)

- Assigns a relation score indicating the strength of the relationship

- The enriched dataset is then made available for download, enabling further analysis, validation, or downstream processing.
